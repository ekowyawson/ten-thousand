# Ten Thousand v1 - Prompts Used for AI Generation

## Prompt 1

- Below are instructions on coding a python game called ten thousand. Parse the instructions and complete the code please:
  - Project named `ten-thousand`.
  - We will be tackling the highest risk and/or highest priority features - `scoring` and `dice rolling`.
    - Define a `GameLogic` class in `game_logic.py` file.
    - Handle calculating score for dice roll:
      - Add `calculate_score` static method to `GameLogic` class.
      - The input to `calculate_score` is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
      - The output from `calculate_score` is an integer representing the roll’s score according to **rules of game**.
  
    - Handle rolling dice:
      - Add `roll_dice` static method to `GameLogic` class.
      - The input to `roll_dice` is an integer between `1` and `6`.
      - The output of `roll_dice` is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
      - The length of tuple must match the argument given to `roll_dice` method.

  - Rules of the Game
    - When rolling 1 to 6 dice ensure:
      - A sequence of correct length is returned
      - Each item in sequence is an integer with value between 1 and 6

  - Calculate Score
    - **zilch** - roll with no scoring dice should return 0
    - **ones** - rolls with various number of 1s should return correct score
    - **twos** - rolls with various number of 2s should return correct score
    - **threes** - rolls with various number of 3s should return correct score
    - **fours** - rolls with various number of 4s should return correct score
    - **fives** - rolls with various number of 5s should return correct score
    - **sixes** - rolls with various number of 6s should return correct score
    - **straight** - 1,2,3,4,5,6 should return correct score
    - **three_pairs** - 3 pairs should return correct score
    - **two_trios** - 2 sets of 3 should return correct score
    - **leftover_ones** - 1s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score
    - **leftover_fives** - 5s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score

## AI Response 1

Your instructions outline the requirements for creating a command-line version of the dice game "Ten Thousand" in Python. The key tasks include:

1. **Project Name**: The project is named `ten-thousand`.
2. **Core Features**: The focus is on two main features: `scoring` and `dice rolling`.
    - **GameLogic Class**: This class should be defined in a file named `game_logic.py`.
    - **Calculating Score**:
        - Implement a static method `calculate_score` within the `GameLogic` class.
        - This method takes a tuple of integers representing a dice roll as input.
        - It outputs an integer representing the score of the roll based on the game's rules.
    - **Rolling Dice**:
        - Implement a static method `roll_dice` in the `GameLogic` class.
        - This method takes an integer between 1 and 6 as input.
        - It outputs a tuple of random values between 1 and 6.
        - The length of the output tuple must match the input argument.

Now, let's start coding the `GameLogic` class in Python. We'll tackle the `roll_dice` and `calculate_score` methods.

I've implemented the `GameLogic` class for the "Ten Thousand" dice game in Python, including two key methods:

1. `roll_dice(num_dice)`: This method takes an integer `num_dice`, representing the number of dice to roll (between 1 and 6). It returns a tuple of random integers between 1 and 6, each representing the outcome of one dice roll.

2. `calculate_score(dice_roll)`: This method calculates the score based on a given dice roll, according to the game's rules. The input is a tuple of integers representing a dice roll. The method then calculates the score based on various conditions:
    - Three 1's score 1000 points.
    - Three of any number other than 1's score 100 times the number.
    - A single 1 (not part of a set of three) scores 100 points.
    - A single 5 (not part of a set of three) scores 50 points.
    - A straight (1-6) scores 1500 points.
    - Three pairs score 1500 points.

An example usage is provided at the end, where the program rolls six dice and then calculates the score based on the roll.

## AI Response 2

To ensure that the calculate_score method in the GameLogic class passes the provided test suite, the method must be updated to accurately reflect the scoring rules specified in the tests.

The tests cover various scenarios, including scoring for singles, multiples, straights, and other combinations. I will revise the calculate_score method to make sure it adheres to these rules and passes all the tests.

Let's modify the calculate_score method:

```python
class GameLogic:
    """
    Updated GameLogic class to ensure it passes the provided test suite.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice_roll):
        score = 0
        dice_count = Counter(dice_roll)

        # Check for straight, three pairs, and six of a kind (instant win)
        if len(dice_count) == 6:
            return 1500  # Straight
        if len(dice_count) == 3 and all(count == 2 for count in dice_count.values()):
            return 1500  # Three pairs

        # Scoring for multiples and single ones or fives
        for num, count in dice_count.items():
            if count >= 3:
                if num == 1:
                    # For three ones, score is 1000, and doubles for each additional one
                    score += 1000 * 2 ** (count - 3)
                else:
                    # For other numbers, score is 100 times the number, and doubles for each additional number
                    score += num * 100 * 2 ** (count - 3)
            elif num == 1:
                score += count * 100  # 100 points for each single one
            elif num == 5:
                score += count * 50  # 50 points for each single five

        return score

# The calculate_score method is now expected to pass the provided test suite.

```

The updated GameLogic class with the revised calculate_score method is designed to handle the various scoring scenarios as specified in the test suite. This includes handling singles, multiples, straights, and other specific combinations like three pairs

## AI Response 3

The test failures indicate that the scoring logic for multiples (four of a kind, five of a kind, and six of a kind) is not correctly implemented according to the test suite's expectations. I will revise the calculate_score method to correctly handle these cases.

The primary issue seems to be in the calculation for multiples of a number beyond three of a kind. For these cases, the score needs to be calculated differently than it currently is. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

```python
class GameLogic:
    """
    Updated GameLogic class with corrected scoring logic for multiples.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice_roll):
        score = 0
        dice_count = Counter(dice_roll)

        # Check for straight and three pairs
        if len(dice_count) == 6:
            return 1500  # Straight
        if len(dice_count) == 3 and all(count == 2 for count in dice_count.values()):
            return 1500  # Three pairs

        # Scoring for multiples and single ones or fives
        for num, count in dice_count.items():
            if count >= 3:
                if num == 1:
                    # For three ones, score is 1000
                    score += 1000
                    if count > 3:
                        # For each additional one, the score doubles
                        score += 1000 * (2 ** (count - 3) - 1)
                else:
                    # For other numbers, score is 100 times the number
                    score += num * 100
                    if count > 3:
                        # For each additional number, the score doubles
                        score += num * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3) - 1)
            elif num == 1:
                score += count * 100  # 100 points for each single one
            elif num == 5:
                score += count * 50  # 50 points &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203; for each single five.

        return score
```

With this updated logic:

- For three of a kind, the base score is calculated as before.
- For four, five, or six of a kind, the score for each additional die beyond the third one is double the previous total for that number. For example, four 2s would score 400 (200 for three 2s and an additional 200 for the fourth 2), and five 2s would score 800 (400 for four 2s and an additional 400 for the fifth 2).

This updated method should now correctly handle the scenarios outlined in the failed tests. Please run this revised code in your test suite to verify its correctness. If there are any further discrepancies or adjustments needed, let me know!
